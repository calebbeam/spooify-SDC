For this project, the Sytems Design Capstone, I was tasked with optimizing the perfomance of an existing application by exploring the structure of the backend. Added below are the journal I published and the video journal entry created for the presentation portion of the project.

Overall, I really enjoyed learning more about testing systems and what can affect the overall performance on a large scale. This project taught me quite a bit about the complexity of backend development.
